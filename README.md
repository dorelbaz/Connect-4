The game "four in a row" is played on a board with 7 columns in which up to 5 disks can be placed.
Each player in turn places one disk at the top of one of the columns (which still has free space), the columns
are filled from the bottom up. Each player has disks of a different color, for example the disks of one player â€¬
are red, and the other player's disks are blue. The first player that succeeds in creating a continuous series of disks, of his color, wins. A continuous series of disks can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
